OneTime: an open source encryption program that uses the one-time pad method.

(Run 'onetime --help' for usage information.)

The usual public-key encryption programs, such as GnuPG, are probably
secure for everyday purposes, but their implementations are too
complex for all but the most knowledgeable programmers to vet, and
in some cases there may be vulnerable steps in the supply chain
between their authors and the end user.  When bootstrapping trust,
it helps to start with something you can trust by inspection.

Hence this script, OneTime, a simple program that encrypts plaintexts
against one-time pads.  If you don't know what one-time pads are, this
program may not be right for you.  If you do know what they are and
how to use them, this program can make using them more convenient.

OneTime handles some of the pad-management bureaucracy for you.  It
avoids re-using pad data -- except when decrypting the same message
twice -- by maintaining records of pad usage in ~/.onetime/pad-records.
(The pads themselves are not typically stored there, just records
about pad usage.)

Recommended practice: if you are Alice communicating with Bob, then
keep two different pads, 'alice_to_bob.pad' and 'bob_to_alice.pad', as
opposed to sharing the same pad for both directions of communication.
With two separate pads, even if you each send a message simultaneously
to the other with no advance planning, you still won't accidentally
use any of the same pad data twice, assuming you let OneTime do its
bookkeeping naturally.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad for more information
about one-time pads in general.

########################### Design Overview #############################
# 
# To encrypt, OneTime first compresses input using bzip2, then XOR's
# the bzipped stream against the pad, and emits the result in base64
# encoding.  It also records in ~/.onetime/pad-records that that
# length of pad data, starting from a particular offset, has been
# used, so that the user won't ever re-use that stretch of pad for
# encryption again.
#
# To decrypt, OneTime does the reverse: base64-decode the input, XOR
# it against the pad (starting at the pad offset specified in the
# encrypted message), and bunzip2 the result.  Decryption also records
# that this range has been used, in ~/.onetime/pad-records, because
# the recipient of a message should of course never use the same
# pad data to encrypt anything else.
#
# The output format looks like this:
#
# -----BEGIN OneTime MESSAGE-----
# Format: internal  << NOTE: OneTime 1.x and older cannot read this format. >>
# Pad ID: [...64 hexadecimal digits of unique pad ID...]
# Offset: [...a number expressed in decimal...]
# 
# [...encrypted block, base64-encoded...]
# 
# -----END OneTime MESSAGE-----
#
# The encrypted block has some structure, though -- it's not *just* a
# base64 encoding of pad-XOR'd bzipped plaintext data.  Before and
# after the core data, there's some bookkeeping, all base64-encoded.
# Here's a diagram, with index increasing from left to right:
#
#   RRRRFFHHTT******-------------------------------------DDDD*******
#
# The precise number of same characters in a row is not significant
# above, except as a rough guide to the relative lengths of the 
# different sections.  This is what the different sections mean:
#
#   R  ==  some bytes of raw pad input for the session hash
# 
#          These bytes are among the data fed to the session hash, so
#          that the final message digest authenticates the pad as well
#          as the plaintext.  (The actual number of bytes used is
#          PadSession._digest_source_length.)
# 
#   F  ==  a few format indicator bytes:
#
#          These tell OneTime what version of its internal format it
#          is looking at.  This is really just for future-proofing,
#          since these internal format indicator bytes were only
#          introduced in 2.0, and as of this writing OneTime is still
#          using that first format (known as "internal format 0").
#
#   H  ==  a few head fuzz source length bytes:
# 
#          A few bytes of raw pad data, used to calculate
#          the number of bytes of head fuzz (the first 
#          set of asterisks) that will be used.
#
#   T  ==  a few tail fuzz source length bytes:
# 
#          A few more bytes of raw pad data, used to calculate
#          the number of bytes of tail fuzz (the concluding
#          set of asterisks) that will be used. 
#
#   *  ==  a random number of fuzz bytes (head fuzz or tail fuzz):
# 
#          A random number (derived from the pad -- see above) of
#          runtime-generated random or pseudo-random bytes, XOR'd
#          against the same number of pad bytes.
#          
#          When these encrypted bytes appear at the front, they are
#          called "head fuzz", and because the number of bytes is
#          based on pad data, they prevent an attacker from knowing
#          exactly where in the encrypted text the message starts.
#          When they appear at the end they are called "tail fuzz",
#          and similarly, they mean that an attacker does not know
#          exactly where the message ends.  
#
#          In other words, the real message (and its digest, described
#          below) sits somewhere along a slider surrounded by fuzz on
#          each side, and the precise amount of fuzz on each side is
#          known only to those with the pad.  This prevents a
#          known-plaintext message substitution attack: because
#          attackers cannot know where the message is, they cannot
#          reliably replace a known plaintext with some other
#          plaintext of the same length, even with channel control.
# 
#          The reason the fuzz regions are random data XOR'd against
#          pad, instead of just being plain pad data (which would have
#          been theoretically sufficient) is to avoid exposing weak
#          pads.  Even though it would be a bad mistake for a user to
#          use a merely pseudo-random pad, instead of a truly random
#          one, still at least OneTime should do its best to avoid
#          exposing this mistake in an obvious way when it happens.
# 
#   -  ==  encrypted plaintext
# 
#          Base64-encoded XOR'd bzipped plaintext.
#
#   D  ==  32 bytes of digest
#
#          A SHA256 digest, XOR'd with pad, of: the raw pad session
#          hash input bytes, plus the raw head fuzz (that is, the
#          random bytes from *before* they were XOR'd with the pad to
#          produce the final head fuzz), plus the plaintext message. 
#          
#          The purpose of this digest verify message integrity without
#          revealing anything about the pad (because we don't want an
#          attacker to be able to analyze whether the pad itself might
#          have any weaknesses).  Using a combined digest means that
#          even in the case of a known plaintext there is no plaintext
#          substitution attack and no way to recover any of the raw
#          pad bytes.
#
#   (Note that this is not a hexadecimal representation of the hash;
#   to save space, it is the raw hash digest.  However, any integrity
#   errors display the hash in hexadecimal.)
#
# On decryption, OneTime verifies both the digest and that the tail
# fuzz is exactly as long as expected.  If anything doesn't match,
# OneTime will raise an error -- though if the error was detected only
# in the digest or in the tail fuzz length, then there may still have
# been a successful decryption first, with plaintext output emitted.
# 
# OneTime takes care never to expose even raw pad bytes that aren't
# going to be used for encryption.  Although in theory the pad should
# be completely random, and therefore an exposure of pad bytes that
# aren't used for encryption should not reveal anything about other
# bytes that *are* used for encryption, in practice, if someone is
# using a pad that is not perfectly random, we don't want OneTime to
# make that situation any worse than it has to be.  Therefore, in two
# places that could potentially expose such raw pad bytes, we don't:
#
#   1) To calculate the pad ID (which is recorded in the file
#      ~/.onetime/pad-records, which we have to assume could get
#      exposed to an attacker), we use the hexadecimal digest of a
#      SHA256 hash of some bytes from the front of the pad, instead of
#      just using a hex representation of those bytes in raw form.
#
#   2) When inserting head fuzz and tail fuzz into the encrypted
#      message, we don't just use raw pad bytes, but rather XOR raw
#      pad bytes against run-time-generated random bytes, so that the
#      fuzz regions reveal as little as possible about the pad and
#      are, ideally, in no way distinguishable on inspection from the
#      encrypted data between them.
# 
# As for the code, the design is pretty much what you'd expect:
# 
# The PadSession class encapsulates one session of using a pad to
# encrypt or decrypt one contiguous data stream.  It takes care of
# everything that happens in the encrypted block above.
# 
# A PadSession object is created with a particular pad file and
# registered with a Configuration object.  The Configuration object
# reads the ~/.onetime/pad-records file, to ensure that the PadSession
# starts from the right offset in the pad, and it records in
# ~/.onetime/pad-records that a new stretch of pad is consumed, once
# the PadSession is done.
#
# A PadSession is wrapped with a SessionEncoder if encrypting or with
# a Sessiondecoder if decrypting.  These wrapper classes take care of
# the base64 encoding.
# 
########################################################################

# The current format level.
#
# Some background is needed to understand what this means:
#
# The first releases of OneTime (the 1.x series) did not include any
# indication of the format in the plaintext headers of the output.
# This was deliberate: after all, if there *were* a format change in
# the future, a "Format:" header could be added, and its presence
# would indicate that the output was clearly from a later version than
# the 1.x series.
#
# Well, that has now happened -- but instead of specifying an exact
# format version in the plaintext header, we just specify that the
# format is "internal", and in the code we call that a "format level"
# instead of a "format version".  We distinguish between this new
# "internal" level and the old level (now retroactively labeled
# "original"), for the purpose of supporting OneTime 1.x and earlier,
# but beyond that the plaintext header does not say anything about the
# format other than that label "internal".
#
# There are a couple of reasons to do it this way.  One, to get away
# from the idea that the version of OneTime is relevant, since that
# what really matters is just the output format -- which can and often
# will remain unchanged, or at least backward-compatible, from version
# to version of OneTime.  Two, starting from OneTime 2.0, all detailed
# format version information is embedded in "inner headers" in the
# ciphertext (see the PadSession class for details), not in the plaintext
# headers.  This avoids leaking information about the earliest
# possible date on which the message could have been encrypted,
# because the ciphertext will reveal only that the message must have
# been encrypted with OneTime 2.0 or higher.
#
# Therefore, in OneTime's code, instead of using numbers for the
# format level, we use one of two words: "internal" or "original".
#
# Note also that the "original" format had a (rather embarrassing) bug
# whereby plaintext was encrypted and then compressed, instead of the
# other way around.  This is fixed in all the "internal" level
# formats, and of course any further format details are now embedded
# in the inner headers in the cipthertext, as described in class PadSession.
# (And no, http://blog.appcanary.com/2016/encrypt-or-compress.html
# does not contradict that compress-then-encrypt is right for OneTime.)

    #   2) Read a sender-specified length that is encrypted in the
    #      pad right here ("here" being right after the inner header
    #      bytes), and then use that length.
    #
    # Right now we only use method (1), but support for method (2) is
    # built into the inner header format; see _make_inner_header().
    #

    #
    # First we read NUM_BYTES bytes from the pad (the bytes are
    # consumed -- they won't be used for encrypting or decrypting
    # data).
    #
    # We then portably convert that sequence of bytes to a number
    # modulo MODULO.  The result is the number of bytes of fuzz.

    #     The first byte indicates the internal format version --
    #     think of it as the "x" in "internal.x", where "internal"
    #     comes from the plaintext "Format:" header.  Values 0-127 are

    #       0b_______*: 0 means use the default fuzz length
    #                   1 means next byte(s) hold sender-chosen fuzz length

    #       0b*_______: reserved; must be 0 in internal format 0
    # 
    #     If the first bit were set, then the next byte would indicate

    #     course), or a length partly determined by the pad (similarly
    #     to the current code below) but with a sender-chosen minimum.
    #     That's all TBD: we don't support internal format 1 yet, only
    #     0, and in 0 the fuzz lengths come entirely from pad data.
    # 
    #     The meanings of the rest of the flag bits are not yet
    #     determined, and their values must be zero in format 2.0.
    #     (The value of the first bit must be zero right now, too,
    #     since sender-chosen lengths are not yet implemented, but at

    #
    # You may be wondering, why do we have fuzz at all?
    #
    # By prepending and appending random amounts of data (the head
    # fuzz and tail fuzz), we make it impossible for the attacker to
    # know exactly where the real encrypted text starts and ends or
    # how long the encrypted text is.
    #
    # This means she can't derive the relevant part of the pad, so she
    # can't substitute another plaintext, even if she knows the
    # original plaintext; and if she doesn't know the original
    # plaintext, she has no way to derive the length of the plaintext
    # from the encrypted text.
    #
    # The fuzz isn't the only thing preventing substitution, because
    # encrypted messages are also authenticated with checksums made
    # from both pad data and plaintext data.  But this way an attacker
    # has only a "1 / fuzz_length" chance of even guessing where in
    # the message the compressed plaintext *is*, regardless of whether
    # she has a known plaintext -- the tail fuzz distance means she
    # can't just count backwards from the end of the ciphertext.
    #
    # We can't afford to disguise the position or length by very much,
    # because pad isn't cheap and we don't want to use it up on fuzz.
    # Hence, self._default_fuzz_source_modulo is currently 512.  We
    # will read two bytes two determine the head fuzz distance (i.e.,
    # the head fuzz distance will be 0 <= N <= 511), and read the next
    # two bytes to determine the tail fuzz distance (ditto).
    #
    # It's tempting to set a higher modulus than 512, but given the
    # rate at which I at least can generate new pad data, that feels
    # too costly.  512 feels like the right point in the tradeoff
    # slider.  If anyone has data to support a different number, I
    # hope they'll speak up.  With self._default_fuzz_source_length at
    # two bytes, we could go all the way up to 65535, so most of this
    # code can stay the same if we later decide to expand the range.
    # (There's no particular reason the modulus has to be a power of
    # two, either, other than good taste.)
    #
    # Remember that the 512 should not be thought of as a key length.
    # The number of possibilities here is 1-in-512, not 1-in-(2^512).
    #
    # A possible improvement would be to fuzz by bits instead of
    # bytes, so we get 8 times the variability for the amount of pad
    # used up.  But fuzzing by bits would complicate the code, since
    # all the seeking and I/O is natively aligned on 8-bit boundaries,

How to Generate a One-Time Pad
==============================

These commands will create a pad on computers that have a local source
of random bytes at /dev/random and the ability to copy those bytes
with the `dd` command.  Most GNU/Linux computers can do this.

  $ mkdir -p ~/.onetime
  $ dd if=/dev/random of=~/.onetime/to_foo.pad bs=1000 count=10000

That command will place a 10 megabyte pad in ~/.onetime/to_foo.pad
(1000000 bytes is one megabyte).  That pad will be good for encrypting
10 megabytes of data before it should be retired.  If you anticipate
sending more than 10 megabytes of data with the same pad, increase the
count accordingly.  On some computers, large pads may take a long
time, even days, to generate.  Just let dd work while you do other
things.  (Although you can go faster by using /dev/urandom instead of
/dev/random, opinion is divided on whether the random numbers from
/dev/urandom are good enough; to be safe, we recommend /dev/random,
but see http://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/ for more discussion.)

To encrypt a file named WALLET.DAT with that pad:

  $ onetime -e -p ~/.onetime/to_foo.pad WALLET.DAT

(produces WALLET.DAT.onetime).

  usage_str = """\
OneTime version %s, an open source encryption program that uses one-time pads.

Typical usage:

  onetime -e -p PAD MSG           (encrypt; write output to 'MSG.onetime')
  onetime -d -p PAD MSG.onetime   (decrypt; output loses '.onetime' suffix)

Other usage modes:

  onetime [-e|-d] -p PAD -o OUTPUT INPUT  (both INPUT and OUTPUT are files)
  onetime [-e|-d] -p PAD -o - INPUT       (output goes to stdout)
  onetime [-e|-d] -p PAD                  (input from stdin, output to stdout)
  onetime [-e|-d] -p PAD -o OUTPUT        (input from stdin, output to OUTPUT)

OneTime remembers what ranges of what pad files have been used, and avoids
re-using those ranges when encrypting, by keeping records in ~/.onetime/.

All options:

   -e                      Encrypt
   -d                      Decrypt
   -p PAD | --pad=PAD      Use PAD for pad data.
   -o OUT | --output=OUT   Output to file OUT ("-" for stdout)
   --offset=N              Control the pad data start offset
   -n | --no-trace         Leave no record of pad usage in your config
   -C DIR | --config=DIR   Specify DIR (instead of ~/.onetime) as config area;
                           '-' for DIR means use no config area (implies -n)
   --show-id               Show a pad's ID; used with -p only
   --intro                 Show an introduction to OneTime and one-time pads
   -v | -V | --version     Show version information
   --license               Show full open source license information
   --pad-help              Show help on how to generate one-time pads
